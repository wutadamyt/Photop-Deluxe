# Photop-Deluxe
A couple improvements to Photop.

Features:
+ Change theme color
+ Save up to 5 themes
+ Adds typing notifications to chats

How to Install:
### With an extension
+ Find a Chrome extension that lets you inject code into a website. Add it, and make sure it injects the code automatically. I use [Code Injector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-injector/jgcallaoodbhagkaoobenaabockcejmc).
+ Make sure you have the url to app.photop.live
### Without an extension
+ Go to [code.js's raw page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wutadamyt/Photop-Deluxe/main/code.js) and copy the entire code.
+ Create a bookmark of any page.
+ Right-click the bookmark, name it "Photop Deluxe", and type "javascript:" in the URL.
+ Paste the code and press Save.
+ Every time you open Photop, click Photop Deluxe in the bookmarks bar to activate it.
