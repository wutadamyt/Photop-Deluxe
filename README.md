# Photop-Deluxe
A couple improvements to Photop.

Features:
+ Change theme color
+ Save up to 5 themes
+ Adds typing notifications to chats

How to Install:
+ Find a Chrome extension that lets you inject code into a website. Add it, and make sure it injects the code automatically. I use [Code Injector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-injector/jgcallaoodbhagkaoobenaabockcejmc).
+ Make sure you have the url to app.photop.live
